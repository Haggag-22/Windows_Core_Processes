# Windows Process Monitoring

This project involves creating a comprehensive blog that explores the critical role of monitoring key Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`, `lsass.exe`, `winlogon.exe`, and `explorer.exe`. Each section provides an in-depth analysis of these processes, highlighting their standard behaviors, the parent-child relationships that govern their operations, and common indicators of suspicious activity. 

By focusing on the nuances of these processes, the blog aims to educate readers on the importance of proactive monitoring to enhance system security. Understanding these elements is vital for recognizing potential threats and mitigating risks effectively.

Continuous observation of these processes and their relationships allows system administrators to detect anomalies, ensuring that any malicious behavior is identified and addressed promptly.
